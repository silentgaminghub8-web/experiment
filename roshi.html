                    <h3>1. 0% Profit Model</h3>
                    <p>Our Tournament System is completely fair and transparent, operating on a 0% profit model. The entire collection from entry fees goes directly into the prize pool. Even if you don't win, you can earn through per-kill rewards and other bonus opportunities.</p>

                    <p>Our biggest responsibility is to ensure every player gets their due reward. Our reward system is auto-calculated and error-free, ensuring fairness for all participants. Every player can earn based on their performance, not just the top winner.</p>

                    <p>Our tournament's security is built on two strong pillars: our "Hacker Killer" Anti-Hack team that actively bans cheaters, and our CEO, Ujjawal Malik, who personally oversees operations to maintain fairness.</p>

                    <p>To ensure our team performs at its best, Monday and Tuesday are designated rest days. No tournaments will be held on these days. This allows our team to recharge and provide an even better experience for the rest of the week.</p>
